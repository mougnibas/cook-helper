# TODOs

1) Create an Oomph setup.
1) Find a way to use FindBugs in eclipse, like checkstyle and PMD plugin, with auto config using maven.
1) maven-javadoc-plugin show errors on build.
1) Don't use a custom assembly : Try to use the default one and exclude maven and eclipse stuff.
1) Add another module to add some recipes for building a "weekly bill of materials"
